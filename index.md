## Data Collection
Our data is collected from the <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/m7n3zvg539/6">ecSeg repository</a>, where we use the `train_im` and `test_im` images. Connected component analysis is performed on the images to find the number of nuclei, chromosomes, and ecDNA using the `ndimage` method from the `scipy` library. This process is performed on train and test data, and these counts are then stored in CSV files.
