## Data Collection
Our data is collected from the <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/m7n3zvg539/6">ecSeg repository</a>. We use the `train_im` and `test_im` images. Connected component analysis is performed on the images to find the number of nuclei, chromosomes, and ecDNA using the `ndimage` method from the `scipy` library. This process was performed on train and test data.
